          <h4 class="text-white mt-0">Customer discovery</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
The main customer segment that we are targeting consists of small and medium business like shops and restaurants. So, we decided to create two online forms with some relevant questions to collect feedback from cusomers of restaurant and the second one from resturants administrators and workers and to discover what they think about our solution and to discuss directly with our colleagues and friends about our idea to see if they are interested or not.
<br/> Also, we contacted some restaurants administrators to see if they are willing to use our solution. So, we sent some emails in which we described our idea.
And we also used the vast knowledge our partener, Aristarch Software, has in this field.

            <br>
          <h5 class="text-left text-white mt-0 ml-3">Information from our customer segment</h5>

            <ul>
              <p class="text-center text-white-50 mb-4">
For customers of the restaurants we targeted normal people who go to restaurant and we approached most of them via online questionnaires.
 We asked people who were in online groups with a lot of students or mature people to distribute our questionnaire. We asked around 80 people about how frecquently they go to restaurants and more than 65% voted that they go often.
 You can acces our first formular here.

			</p>
              <p class="text-center text-white-50 mb-4">
We decided to share also an form with the clients that Aristarch Software has to quantify the opinion of people regarding restaurants industry services.
 The questions from the form helped us to convience ourselves of the problems regarding the restaurants industry services that stay at the foundation of our project.
 You cand see all our questions in the form here.

          <h4 class="text-white mt-0">How these insights have affected our produc</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
From the form sent to the restaurant employees, it was found that the areas in which the management is carried out with difficulty are: order management (55.3%), personnel management (52.6%) and inventory management (44.7%). These results show that in about half of the restaurants there are management problems in these areas. Thus, we decided, based on these results, that our project must focus in particular on how these three problems can be reduced, and the result of our project will thus be a specialized IT solution on optimizing and facilitating the management of orders, personnel and stock
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-white mt-0">Do you consider that you are ready to move to the Customer Validation stage?</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
Until now, we discussed about the idea, if it resolves an actual problem that many people face with it and the answers of interviewed people was positive. So, we think that we are ready to move to the Customer Validation stage to discover if the potential customers consider that our solution is useful and to see if they want to support our idea. We contacted some potential customers, and we are waiting for feedback, but we need more than one to decide if our idea can be validated or not. We will continue to contact the potential customers, to obtain more points of view about our idea.          </p>

          <p class="text-left text-white ">
		  To bring people on our product's landing page, we share it in some relevant groups on Facebook.
On Facebook, we looked for groups relevant to our field and we found three groups that matched our needs.

		  </p>
          <p class="text-left text-white ">
The first one is one of the biggest master students related group on Facebook and the second one contains all our colleagues. This groups had similar responses.

          <p class="text-left text-white ">
And the third one is the facebook page of startup nation. In this group we have reached 95 reactions.

		  To better understand the needs and behavor of our future clients and to find the best solutions to their problems we used the following methods:
            <ul class="text-left text-white mb-4">
              <li class="text-white">Newsletter
			  <p>
			  The users can subscribe to our newsletter to find out the latest news about our app, this being a good way to collect data about them(phone number, email, etc.).
              <img class="rounded mb-1 img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="img/Capture.PNG">

			  So far we have accomplished to convince 3 people to subscribe to our newsletters.
			  </p>
			  </li>
          <h2 class="text-white mt-0 text-center">Visitors</h2>
		  <p>To track the number of visitors on our landing page, we used Google Analytics and Hotjar.</p>			  

              <li class="text-white">Google Analytics
			  <p> Even if the reach and reactions were the good on Facebook, the results weren’t as good as we expected.
			  Maybe this happened because people don’t pay as much attention of Facebook as they used to or maybe we haven’t chose the audience very good.
			  </p>			  
              </li>
              <li class="text-white">Hotjar
			  <p>A nice feature that Hotjar provide are heatmaps. Using this feature we can see where people spent most of their time on our page and where they clicked. </p>			  
              </li>
            </ul>
