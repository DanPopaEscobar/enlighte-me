          <h4 class="text-white mt-0">Customer discovery</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
The main customer segment that we are targeting consists of small and medium business like shops and restaurants. So, we decided to create two online forms with some relevant questions to collect feedback from cusomers of restaurant and the second one from resturants administrators and workers and to discover what they think about our solution and to discuss directly with our colleagues and friends about our idea to see if they are interested or not.
<br/> Also, we contacted some restaurants administrators to see if they are willing to use our solution. So, we sent some emails in which we described our idea.
And we also used the vast knowledge our partener, Aristarch Software, has in this field.

            <br>
          <h5 class="text-left text-white mt-0 ml-3">Information from our customer segment</h5>

            <ul>
              <p class="text-center text-white-50 mb-4">
For customers of the restaurants we targeted normal people who go to restaurant and we approached most of them via online questionnaires.
 We asked people who were in online groups with a lot of students or mature people to distribute our questionnaire. We asked around 80 people about how frecquently they go to restaurants and more than 65% voted that they go often.
 You can acces our first formular here.

              <p class="text-center text-white-50 mb-4">
We decided to share also an form with the clients that Aristarch Software has to quantify the opinion of people regarding restaurants industry services.
 The questions from the form helped us to convience ourselves of the problems regarding the restaurants industry services that stay at the foundation of our project.
 You cand see all our questions in the form here.

          <h4 class="text-white mt-0">How these insights have affected our produc</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
From the form sent to the restaurant employees, it was found that the areas in which the management is carried out with difficulty are: order management (55.3%), personnel management (52.6%) and inventory management (44.7%). These results show that in about half of the restaurants there are management problems in these areas. Thus, we decided, based on these results, that our project must focus in particular on how these three problems can be reduced, and the result of our project will thus be a specialized IT solution on optimizing and facilitating the management of orders, personnel and stock

          <h4 class="text-white mt-0">Do you consider that you are ready to move to the Customer Validation stage?</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
Until now, we discussed about the idea, if it resolves an actual problem that many people face with it and the answers of interviewed people was positive. So, we think that we are ready to move to the Customer Validation stage to discover if the potential customers consider that our solution is useful and to see if they want to support our idea. We contacted some potential customers, and we are waiting for feedback, but we need more than one to decide if our idea can be validated or not. We will continue to contact the potential customers, to obtain more points of view about our idea.          </p>

          <p class="text-center text-white ">
		  To bring people on our product's landing page, we share it in some relevant groups on Facebook.
On Facebook, we looked for groups relevant to our field and we found three groups that matched our needs.

		  </p>
          <p class="text-center text-white ">
The first one is one of the biggest master students related group on Facebook and the second one contains all our colleagues. This groups had similar responses.

          <p class="text-center text-white ">
And the third one is the facebook page of startup nation. In this group we have reached 95 reactions.

		  </p>
		  <br/>
          <p class="text-left text-white ">
		  To better understand the needs and behavor of our future clients and to find the best solutions to their problems we used the following methods:
            <ul class="text-left text-white mb-4">
              <li class="text-white">Newsletter
			  <p>
			  The users can subscribe to our newsletter to find out the latest news about our app, this being a good way to collect data about them(phone number, email, etc.).
              <img class="rounded mb-1 img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="img/Capture.PNG">

			  So far we have accomplished to convince 3 people to subscribe to our newsletters.

			  <ul class="text-left text-white mb-4">
              <li class="text-white">Google Analytics
			  <p> Even if the reach and reactions were the good on Facebook, the results weren’t as good as we expected.
			  Maybe this happened because people don’t pay as much attention of Facebook as they used to or maybe we haven’t chose the audience very good.

</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
 The size of the market is dynamically changing, but an approximate number would be around 2000 locally.
          </p>
            <br>
          <h4 class="text-white mt-0">Determine the approximate number of players / competitors in your targeted market
</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
After we analyzed the market, we identified 3 major competitors that aproached the same areas: AsiS Restaurant, Nexus Restaurant and Freya Restaurant.
<br/>
<br/>
 The main competitor would be Freya Restaurant one of the biggest players on the Romanian market.
 The main functionalities besides the classic restaurant management features by which this application is noted are the customization of payment notes and the possibility of planning price changes at certain time intervals. The software company is 15 years old in this field, a turnover of approximately 5.5 million RON and a profit for 2018 of 600.000 RON.
<br/>
<br/>
 Another important competitor is Nexus Retaurant. They have developed a management application that focuses in particular on the management of raw materials and the customization of orders, these being the main needs of a restaurant.
 <br/>
<br/>
 AsiS Restaurant is not as well-known as the other two solutions presented above, but this is still noted by the emphasis it places on the advanced customization of payment notes and on the possibility of elaborately arranging meals.          </p>
            <br>
          <h4 class="text-white mt-0">Present the competition and if possible market share for each competitor
</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
Our competition would be Freya, Nexus and Sedona which are a step ahead of us in terms of experience and age on market.
          </p>
            <br>
          <h4 class="text-white mt-0">Estimate your potential market share in year 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 after launch
</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
In the first years, our target will be to achieve at least 10-15% of the market share. Gradually expending, after the first 5 years, a 50-60% market share would pe possible.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4 class="text-white mt-0">Determine the total market value and the value of your market share for years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
</h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
Considering the fact that our revenue streams are pretty static ($200 monthly subscrition/$300 maintenance subscrition/$50 for every feature on demand), a market value in the first year would be around 60-70k with at least 15% growth every year. After 5 years, we would expect 300k/year in revenue.

		  <br>
          <p class="text-center text-white ">
		  When implementing our solution we wanted the first version of the application to include functionalities
		  that we identified as being indispensable during the stage of idea validation.But also include as many features as possible, to make our product more competitive.
		  </p>
          <p class="text-center text-white ">
		  The main purpose of this prototype is to identify the degree of satisfaction of the users, how much the application helps them in their activity and if they would be willing to pay for the full version of the application.
			The design of the application is a minimalist one, the emphasis being more on functionalities. 
		  Below i will present a few of the functionalities that have been implemented.
		  </p>
          <p class="text-center text-white ">
		  The Log in window, of our app is presented in the image bellow:
		  <br>

		  <br>
		  Here you can visualise the stocks and export them, see the necessary goods, actualise the stock and many more.
		  There was also implemented an inventory functionality to keep easly track of the stocks:

		  In the first image below the products can be visualised, added, edited, exported and deleted.
 		  In the next image the recipies for production of goods can be created and modified:

		  <br>
			 The clients of our co-founder placed a lot of emphasis on various reports that he was missing and most of our attention got into creating those.
			 After a few request there was added a labeling module for markets and shops:

		  <h4 class="text-center text-white mb-2">Conclusions and future work</h4>
		  <br>
          <p class="text-center text-white ">
		  For the moment the application contains the core functionalities that are needed in this kind of application.
		  The Statistics functionality and the Client fidelity functionality were the most requested so our focus was on them and
		  at this point we can admit that our UI and UX had to suffer form the numerous functionalities that we strived to implement.

</h4>
          <p class="text-center text-white-50 mb-4">
			After we developed a functional prototype that includes most of the functionalities for the management of a small to medium business,
			we distribute it to a few clients of our co-founder.
			We encouraged them to provide feedback as honestly as possible so that we can make an impression about what improvements or changes are needed.
            <br>
			After a short training we leaved them for a week to test the app and find out what we cand improve.

          <h4 class="text-white text-left mt-0">
			Feedback method
		  </h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
		  At the end of the week we got back in touch with them and we offered a form to complete in order to get feedback from them.
		  <br>
		  These are the questions we included in the form:
		  <ul class="text-left text-white-50">
		  <li>How much did you like the application?</li>
		  <li>How easy it is to use it?</li>
		  <li>What you don't like?</li>
		  <li>You found yourself stuck while using it?</li>
		  <li>It's intuitive?</li>
		  </ul>

          <h4 class="text-left text-white mt-0">Feedback results
		  </h4>
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
		  After speacking with the first clients, we realised that the app had a lot of features and it was verry useful but it lacked 
		  a lot on UI and UX part, and it was hard to learn how to use it.
		  </p>		  
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
		  Most of them complained about the appearance, being too convoluted and not being intuitive.
		  So we decided that it was time to go back to the drawing board. Then we realised that we should migrate our code entirely to 
		  a new version. So keeping in mind the feedback that we got started.
		  </p>
          <h4 class="text-left text-white mt-0">Version 2.0
		  </h4>  
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
			We started by migration the key functionalities like mesurement units, VATs, categories, 
			products, users and so on. The most necessary features so we could make transation and have
			enough data to extract reports.
			<br>
			<br>
			Below can be visualised the mesurement units and VATs with their CRUD actions:

			<img class="rounded mb-1 img-fluid img-thumbnail" width="360" height="250" src="SE P2/Capture1.PNG">
			<br>

			In the next photos are presented the key functionalities for categories, like add, update, delete, stock reset and so on:

			<img class="rounded mb-1 img-fluid img-thumbnail" width="360" height="250" src="SE P2/Capture4.PNG">
			<br>
			<br>
			The most complaines where found on the products and recipies so we rethought it from scratch.
			<br>
			<img class="rounded mb-1 img-fluid img-thumbnail" width="720" height="250" src="SE P2/Capture5.PNG">
			<img class="rounded mb-1 img-fluid img-thumbnail" width="720" height="350" src="SE P2/Capture6.PNG">
			<img class="rounded mb-1 img-fluid img-thumbnail" width="720" height="350" src="SE P2/Capture7.PNG">
			<br>
			<br>
			We also rethought the discount and users, adding more versatility to them.
			Now you can schedule discounts in advance depending on your desire. Also, there are alot more tipes of 
			users that you can add, with different statuts and rights.
			<br>
			<img class="rounded mb-1 img-fluid img-thumbnail" width="720" height="250" src="SE P2/Capture8.PNG">

          <h4 class="text-left text-white mt-0">As a final thought
		  </h4>  
          <p class="text-left text-white-50 mb-4">
			There was a lot to learn from this experience and we realised that what we thought it was easy
			and intuitive, it wasn't the reality and we lost owerselfs in building a competitive app. Not 
			thinking what the client wants. 
			<br>
			And last but not least, here is a short demo of the future new version at which we are still working.
